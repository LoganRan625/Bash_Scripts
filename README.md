# Bash_Scripts

useful command line scripts in $PATH


# format
# afl

**"afl"** accompanies **"format"**, as **"format"** gives visual representation of files and **"afl"** takes the paths saved 
by **"format"** in plaintext directly from a file, those paths can then be acted on. **"afl"** directly makes changes but 
can also be used to pipe paths as input on the command line.

# conkie
it is probably what you would assume, a cheap version of conky for tty's that have split screen options.

# dirch
changes permisions of entire directory.

# wiki
curl dowloads wiki pages in plain text, based on user input.
